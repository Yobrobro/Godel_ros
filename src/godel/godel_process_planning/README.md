In the blend_process_planning.cpp file, in the src folder, at the beginning of the file (lines 35 to 63) there are two ways that allow the position of the tool. The first section allows for the tool to be positioned in any direction, while the second option allows the tool only to be positioned in certain ways. The second option is recommended for a vacuum tool that follows a zigzag-path.
