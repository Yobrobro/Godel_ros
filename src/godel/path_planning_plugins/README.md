There are two blend_planner.cpp files in the src/openvoronoi folder. They create a different path for the blend tool to follow. One of them calls the profilometer_scan file to make a zigzag pattern, while the other one does not. The version that does not create a zigzag pattern is compatible with octomap at the moment. Implementing octomap for the other version would be a future to do.
